# Resources

### Internal services:

We provide few services solely for internal usage by the [students]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/people/) associated with our lab. These services can only be accessed from within IIT Kharagpur's internal network (LAN & Wifi). 

**Important: The URLs must be added to the "*proxy bypass*" list of your system (The way to do this is OS and browser specific) to be able to run the services.**
